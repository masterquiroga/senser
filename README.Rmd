Fiery app that senses stocks, forex and crypto scores, based on the sentiment analysis of trends and topics in news.


## How to install this

Install the development version directly from GitHub using `devtools`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('masterquiroga/senser')
```


## Design

A REST API that fetches news and posts, and then behind the courtains just
does the data-science pipeline modeling through sentiment analysis.
